# Experiment IDs
Each experiment has a unique ID which refers to the day on which it was run, eg, 1028.
The `Training_index.md` file holds all information on which experiment was run on which parameters and which what data
In `/training/index` you can find all the index files for the different subsets of data. 
The `/training/runs` folder holds all profiles and training output from each experiment.
