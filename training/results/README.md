# Results 

This folder contains the largest part of analysis and plots that can be found in my thesis. 

Each notebook investigates a certain aspect of the trained models and profiles. 

For example `Batch_size.ipynb` investigates the effect of batch sizes on the performance and training parameters.

## Accuracy 

By running the first few lines of the `enrichmentVSaccurcay.ipynb` you can extract the training and validation accuracy + Loss function. 
These are stored in the accucary folder.
