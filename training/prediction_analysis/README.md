# Compound prediction analysis

For one experiment - 819 - I have run the classification model on all data and recorded the predictions. 

with this, I can create confusion matrix and see how good the classification is. 
This could also give insight into well position effects.

I did not use these results in my thesis and only did a short analysis here.
