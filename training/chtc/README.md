# Working on the CHTC Server 

This README gives a practical guide to working on the Wiscon Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC). 
Depending on which version of Deepprofiler you are using, the commands may differ marginaly. 

I am currently writing this guide for the `tf2` branch of DP on the 5th of October 2021. 
All files used in the CHTC can be found in the DP2.1 folder. 
The DP2.0 folder contains old versions of these files. 

While surely not perfect, my setup on CHTC submission server served me well and I will thus present the contents of each folder in the relevant subsection. 
For further reference, here is the relevant structure of the [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/michaelbornholdt/deep_profiler/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) on the CHTC run server.  
```
.
+-- DeepProfiler
|   +-- deepprofiler
|   +-- plugins
etc.
+-- local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/
|   +-- training
|   |   +-- inputs
|   |   +-- outputs
|   |   |   +-- sample_xx
|   |   |   +-- train_xx
|   |   |   +-- profile_xx
|   +-- log_xx.txt
```

- [condor_tail](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man-pages/condor_tail.html): Display the last contents of a running jobâ€™s standard output or file

# Pipeline

The normal pipeline for this project was the following
1. Decide on a subsection data to train on. That can be only part of all classes or all classes but sampled at a smaller fraction. 
2. Sample those crops with a sample-sc command
3. Make sure all crops are valid (check for zero images)
4. Train a model 
5. Profile / infer the profiles
6. Aggregate 
7. Move to cytominer-eval 

## 1. index creation 

The creation of different training indexes is discussed in my thesis and can be traced in the `creating_indexes` noteook in the `train/index` folder. 
All sites will be allocated for either training, validation or unused in the 'Split' column of the index.csv. 
Only the sites marked as 'training' will then cropped to be randomly accessible during training.

Index file example: [826_index.csv](../index/826_index.csv)

## 2. Sampling

The sampling folder on the submit server will typically look like this
```
.
+-- sampling
|   +-- sample.sh
|   +-- sample.sub
|   +-- config_sample.json
|   +-- 924_index.csv
|   +-- XXXXXXXX.log 
|   +-- XXXXXXXX.err
|   +-- XXXXXXXX.out
```

### sample.sub

The first few lines of all submission files are the same.
```bash
universe = docker
docker_image = michaelbornholdt/deep_profiler:tf2_v15
```
This defines which docker will be mounted. [Be careful!]() Never build a docker file with the same name as an old one. 
CHTC will not pull the new docker if it knows the name but use a cached version.  

```bash
accounting_group = COBA
requirements = (Machine == "coba2000.chtc.wisc.edu")
```
These lines simply define which server to run on. Never change these.
```commandline
executable = sample.sh
transfer_executable = true
arguments = $(Cluster)
```
Here you define your executable files and input arguments. 

```commandline
output = $(Cluster).out
error = $(Cluster).err
log = $(Cluster).log
```
Finally your output files are named. These are just useful conventions that can be changed.

### sample.sh

The main command from [sample.sh](DP2.1/sampling/sample.sh) is 
```
python3 deepprofiler --root=/local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/training/ --config=config_sample.json --metadata=924_index.csv --sample=1004_sample sample-sc
```
Note that `/local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/training/` is my project folder in the CHTC structure and `--sample=1004_sample` determines the folder in which the crops will be placed.

Also note that the first lines of sample.sh move the input files (`config_sample.json` and `index_924.csv`) into the correct position in the DeepProfiler structure.
This method will be used in all other bash files.

### config_sample.json

In the [config_sample.json](DP2.1/sampling/config_sample.json), only the following lines are relevant.
```json
 "sampling": {
            "factor": 0.5,
            "workers": 16,
            "cache_size": 40000
            }
```
The factor number defines the fraction of cells cropped in each site. 


## 3. Validating crops

Unfortunately, the crops created in the prior step can have errors. 
This may be the case due to locations files or the sampling command having errors.
Nonetheless, some crops are totally black (all values are zero) and this creates an error during the training process. 
Furthermore, some files can go lost when transfering large numbers of files for example.
The two helper functions `check_crops.py` and `zero_crops.py` find missing files and black crops. 

Both python files live at the `/local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/training/outputs` location.
Additionally, both functions output a `missing_crops.csv` file which can be read on the submission server.

If you did not move the files after sampling, there is no need for running check_crops. 
However, there is always a need to run `zero_crops.py`. 
Running this function should take around 20 - 60 mins. 


## 4. Train

Your train folder may look like this
```
+-- sampling
|   +-- train.sub
|   +-- train.sh
|   +-- config_train.json
|   +-- log_XXXXXXXX
|   +-- err_XXXXXXXX
|   +-- out_XXXXXXXX
```
### train.sh

The [train.sh](DP2.1/train/train.sh) file moves the config to the correct location and then outputs the config for documentation. 

You then define the name of the experiment (I used numbers that refered to dates) and then run the training with the following command:
```commandline
python3 deepprofiler --gpu=0 --metadata=826_index.csv --exp=${NR}_train --sample=826_sample --root=/local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/training --config=config_train.json train --epoch 1 2>&1 | tee /local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/log_${NR}_train.txt
```
Make sure that you are training on an unused gpu (you can check with nvidia-smi beforehand) and make sure that you are using the right sample folder. 
You can also change the epoch value if you want to train on top of a already trained model. 
The final part of the command send all std_out and std_err to the log file. 

### config_train.json

```json
 "model": {
            "name": "efficientnet",
            "augmentations": false,
            "crop_generator": "sampled_crop_generator",
            "metrics": ["accuracy", "top_k"],
            "epochs": 20,
            "initialization":"ImageNet",
            "params": {
                "learning_rate": 0.01,
                "batch_size": 256,
                "conv_blocks": 0,
                "label_smoothing": 0.0,
                "feature_dim": 256,
                "pooling": "avg"
            },
            "lr_schedule": "cosine"
```
Relevant parameters are augmentation, epochs, learning_rate, batch_size and label_smoothing.
Details on these can be found in the [DeepProfiler documentation](https://github.com/cytomining/DeepProfiler/wiki).

For Resnet use: 
```json
"name": "resnet",
"conv_blocks": 50,
```


## 5. Profile


### profile.sh
```
cp 928_train/checkpoint/checkpoint_0020.hdf5 ${NR}_profile/checkpoint/
```
Beware the model from which we are profiling needs to be manually set each time.
The experiment and the epoch number must be correct and in accordance with the config file.

```commandline
python3 deepprofiler --gpu=0 --root=/local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/training --config=config_profile.json --metadata=sub_index.csv --exp=${NR}_profile profile
```
Apart from checking that the GPU is unused, the profile command does not need to be changed. 

If you want to get the class predictions instead of the profiles, you need to simply change the output layer in the config: 

```json
  "profile": {
      "feature_layer": "Compound",
      "checkpoint": "checkpoint_0020.hdf5",
      "batch_size": 512
    }
}
```

## 6. Aggregate

Perform the `run_aggregation.py` after profiling and download the aggregated csv to the submission server. 

Note that the experiment numbers in `aggregate.sub` and in `run_aggregation.py` must be adapted before each submission: 
```bash
# in aggregate.sub
transfer_output_files = /local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/928_aggregated_median.csv
# in run aggregation
experiment = '928_profile'
# and
df_well.to_csv('/local_group_storage/broad_data/michael/928_aggregated_median.csv')
```


## 7. Move to cytoeminer-val

Simply use the following command and your CHTC password to move files from the submission server to your personal PC for downstream processing.

```commandline
scp username@submit-1.chtc.wisc.edu:/home/username/aggregate/XXX_aggregated_median.csv /target/location 
```
